# Kraken Project Architecture

## Overview

Kraken is designed to provide a platform of devices to which either persistant applications can be deployed to as a LAN-based development sandbox, or for one-off jobs to be processed either manually or automatically (i.e. running a script to scrape twitter data via the platform instead of your primary development machine, or automatically running unit tests on a repository whenever a github branch is updated).
